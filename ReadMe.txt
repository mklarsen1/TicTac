Greetings and welcome to the Read Me file for Tic Tac Toe, a game written from the ground up in Python to flex some coding skills.

V.1.0, August 2015
This marks the first usable draft of the game. After an animation announcing the title of the game in ASCII art, the user is prompted to enter a number for a square or allow the computer to choose for her. The game ends when either side gets three in a row.

Future ideas include:
- Choice to play again
- WOPR mode: the game played automatically, with a random square each turn, that inevitably results in a draw
- Konami cheat code to unlock the ability to put your "X" or "O" anywhere; alternatively totally nukes the board with your "X" or "O"
- Speed rounds: the user has only a certain amount of time to make a choice before the round ends and choice returns to the opponent
